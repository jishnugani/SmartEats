# SmartEats: Tailored Diet Chatbot

## Inspiration

Our journey began with the realization of a pressing issue faced by a friend with dietary restrictions, struggling to find suitable meal options. This challenge inspired us to leverage technology to create a solution that not only addresses this problem but does so in a personalized and accessible manner. We envisioned a platform that could understand and cater to individual dietary needs effortlessly, thus giving birth to SmartEats.

## What it does

SmartEats is a custom chatbot that provides users with meal recommendations tailored to their specific dietary requirements. Whether it's allergies, intolerances, preferences, or nutritional goals, SmartEats offers accurate and beneficial meal suggestions. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, accessible via a website that uses CSS and HTML for an engaging user interface.

## How we built it

We built SmartEats by integrating a custom chatbot powered by the OpenAI platform, which allowed us to tailor interactions based on individual user needs. The chatbot was trained with extensive datasets to ensure it could offer personalized and accurate meal suggestions. Alongside, we developed a web interface using HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience from initial inquiry to meal recommendation.

## Challenges we ran into

Our project faced several significant hurdles. Initially, we attempted to develop SmartEats as an Android app and explored using JavaFX for the user interface. However, these approaches led to unexpected complexities and integration issues, significantly slowing our progress. The Android development posed challenges in app deployment and user accessibility, while JavaFX struggled with backend AI integration and responsive design for various devices. Additionally, ensuring the chatbot's recommendations were up-to-date with the latest nutritional guidelines and creating a user interface that catered to diverse tech-savviness levels were ongoing challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the setbacks, we are proud of pivoting successfully to a web-based solution that effectively meets our users' needs. We managed to create a chatbot that accurately understands and responds to a wide range of dietary restrictions and preferences. Our ability to blend AI with intuitive web design, providing a seamless user experience from start to finish, stands as a testament to our team's resilience and adaptability.

## What we learned

This project was a profound learning experience, teaching us not only about the technical aspects of AI and web development but also about the importance of flexibility and user-centered design. We learned to navigate unforeseen challenges, refine our approach based on feedback, and continuously improve our solution to better serve our users.

## What's next for SmartEats

Looking ahead, we aim to expand SmartEats' capabilities by incorporating more advanced AI features, such as natural language processing for even more personalized interactions. We plan to enhance the user interface for greater accessibility and explore partnerships with nutritional experts and food databases to enrich our meal recommendations. Our journey with SmartEats is just beginning, and we are excited to see how it will evolve to meet and exceed the needs of individuals with dietary restrictions.
